🤖 JJ EduArm
Robotic Adventures: Learn, Create, Inspire!

Created by: Myo Htut Kyaw

📌 Project Overview

JJ EduArm is an educational robot arm designed for students aged 10–15, helping them explore programming, engineering, mechanics, and robotics through hands-on learning.
The arm is built to strike the perfect balance between fun, creativity, and real engineering experience, unlike many existing kits that are either too simple or too complex.
